# lets-go

🏄‍♂️ This repository contains contents about Go language and practice with `Vanilla JS`.

I have written the contents of `Go` in the issues section and related simple practice link to each repository via a README.

The goal of this repository is to understand `Go` and to become familiar with its development.
